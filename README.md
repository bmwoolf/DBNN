# DBNN
A BNN simulation framework to test biomolecular neural circuits before lab implementation. 

This can be used by synthetic biologists designing genetic circuits, AI/ML researchers applying computational methods to biology, and biotech companies that are optimizing gene therapy and biosensors. 

The example test cases rely on CAR T cell logic gates.
