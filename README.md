# DBNN
A BNN simulation framework to test biomolecular neural circuits before lab implementation. 

This is based on the paper [A Dynamical Biomolecular Neural Network](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344958092_A_Dynamical_Biomolecular_Neural_Network) from the Weiss Lab at MIT.

This can be used by synthetic biologists designing genetic circuits, AI/ML researchers applying computational methods to biology, and biotech companies that are optimizing gene therapy and biosensors. 

The example test cases rely on CAR T cell logic gates.
